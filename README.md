# QOSF-Mentorship
 This is the answer to screening task 1 of the second round of QOSF mentorship program.

The file task1-v1 uses scipy.optimize.minimize to minimize the cost function and in each update of the cost function builds a new QuantumCircuit object.

In task1-v2 a parametric circuit is built in the begining and the parameters are updated by minimize function.
